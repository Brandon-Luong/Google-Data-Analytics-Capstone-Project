# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
# Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

## Introduction

As part of the Google Data Analytics Program, I am tasked with completing a Capstone case study. The following information is part of the "Share" section of the project in which I present my findings to the stakeholders. I will be presenting the high-level information of each section's deliverable.

The complete project, with code and analysis, can be found in the "capstone_project.Rmd" file.

I have chosen to do this project in R because the dataset file size is too large to comfortably work in spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets). This project can be done in SQL, but R has many handy packages such as tidyverse for data cleaning and analysis.
